abstract={By a method of laser firing, a high zirconia containing (70%) composite membrane on porous ceramic tubing was successfully fabricated. The laser sintered composite membrane was characterized by gas separation/permeation experiments. In the separation experiment of a CO2-CH4 gaseous mixture, it was found that the separation factor of CH4 over CO2 was 1.15. In the pure gases permeation experiment, it was found that Knudsen diffusion is considered to be predominant in the permeation mechanism for pure gases H2, He, CH4, N2, O2, and CO2, and the permeation mechanism of H2O at lower temperature depends mainly on surface diffusion and on Knudsen diffusion at higher temperature.},

abstract={By using a gastight electrochemical cell with flowing air as the reference environment, we were able to achieve an oxygen partial pressure (PO2) as low as 10-16 atm inside the cell. The conductivity of SrFeCo0.5Ox has been studied as a function of PO2 and temperature. It was found that in the high-PO2 range, interstitial oxygen ions (O″i) and electron holes (FeFe •= h•) are the dominant charge carriers, while in the low-PO2 range, oxygen vacancies (Vo ••) and electrons (e′) are dominant. At 800°C in air, total conductivity and ionic conductivity of SrFeCo0.5Ox are 17 and 7 S cm-1, respectively, and the ionic transference number is 0.4. A semiconductor-metal-semiconductor transition is found in this system in a reducedoxygen environment. Defect dynamics in this system can be understood by means of the trivalence-to-divalence transition of Fe ions when PO2 is reduced. A defect model has been proposed. By using the conductivity results, we were able to estimate oxygen permeation through a ceramic membrane made of SrFeCo0.5Ox. The oxygen permeability we calculated is consistent with that measured at the conversion reactor. To confirm the ionic transference number measured by electron-blocking method, electromotive force measurement was carried out and obtained consistent results.},

abstract={Plasma arc technology is a high temperature process that completely oxidizes organic waste fractions: inorganic hazardous and radionuculide waste fractions are oxidized and encapsulated in a highly durable slag. The robust nature of the technology lends itself to application of diverse mixed and hazardous wastestreams. Over 500 hours of testing have been completed at the Department of Energy's Western Environmental Technology Office with a pilot- scale system. This testing was designed to demonstrate operability over a wide range of wastes and provide the data required to evaluate potential applications of the technology on both a technical and economic basis. In addition to characterization of the off gas for typical combustion products, the fate of radionuculide surrogates and hazardous elements within the Plasma Arc Centrifugal Treatment (PACT) system has been investigated extensively. Test results to date demonstrate that cerium, a plutonium surrogate, remains almost exclusively in the slag matrix. Hazardous elements such as chromium and lead volatilize to a greater extent and are captured by the off-gas system. Preliminary design work is underway to develop a minimum emissions off-gas system for demonstration on a engineering-scale plasma unit. The proposed system will filter particulate matter from the hot gas stream and treat them in an electric ceramic oxidizer, which replaces the conventional afterburner, prior to quenching and acid gas removal. Potential future work would use a liquid monoethanolamine system and membrane filter to separate carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the off-gas stream. The remainder of the gas stream, primarily oxygen, would be recycled back to the combustion chamber. This paper will provide: 1) a summary of the design, development, and performance of the PACT off-gas system and 2) results of radionuculide surrogate and hazardous element portioning.},

abstract={Oxygen permeation measurements were performed on dense La1-xSrxFeO3-δ (x = 0.1-0.4) membranes in large oxygen activity gradients, i.e. air/CO, CO2, in the temperature range 1173-1323 K, yielding fluxes up to 25 mmol m-2 s-1 at 1273 K. The oxygen semipermeability was linearly proportional with the CO partial pressure and the strontium content. It was concluded that the fluxes are limited by the surface exchange kinetics. Two simple models are proposed for the oxygen exchange reaction in the presence of CO. In both models oxygen vacancies at the phase boundary play a definite role in the exchange process. XPS and SEM analysis of the perovskite/CO, CO2 interfaces indicated segregation of strontium, being present at the surface mostly in the form of SrCO3 and/or SrO. The enhanced oxygen fluxes in air/He gradients as they were observed after exposure of the membrane surface to CO are probably (indirectly) related to the level of strontium segregation. Based on SEM analysis and surface profile measurements, it is suggested that the segregation process is accompanied by an enlargement of the specific surface area, which may promote the speed of the overall permeation process under exchange-controlled conditions.},

abstract={Ultrathin Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) multilayers have been the focus of interest for use as gas separation membranes because of their well-defined thickness and defect-free structure. A considerable drawback from a technological point of view is the low thermal, chemical and mechanical stability of these films. One solution to this problem is the conversion of an organic multilayer structure, containing inorganic ions, to an organo-ceramic ultrathin film by low-temperature plasma treatment. This article describes the interfacial behaviour and the deposition of magnesium stearate monolayers and their subsequent conversion to organo-ceramic structures. X-ray, FTIR and AFM measurements were used to characterize the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) multilayer structures, chemical compositions and surface topographics respectively: The LB-films consist of highly ordered Y-type multilayer structures with a stepwise surface height profile and nearly all amphiphiles are complexed as the magnesium salt. The modification of these LB-films by both argon and oxygen plasma leads to a decrease in the content of organic material by physical ablation and chemical etching processes. Whilst an internal order is retained within the plasma-treated films, the surface roughness increases significantly. Two parameters of the plasma process, the radio frequency power and the exposure time, were varied in order to find suitable process conditions. It is shown that the non-uniform multilayer structure can be converted to a uniform grainy organo-ceramic structure by plasma treatment.},

abstract={Ceramic ion conducting membranes are a generic group of materials with many potential large-scale applications in solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen generators and partial oxidation reactors. At present the transport and surface exchange kinetic characteristics are emphasized to maximize ionic fluxes. However, as the dense membrane is often fabricated in the form of a thick film on a supported porous structure there is an increasing realization that the available processing routes and thermomechanical behaviour will also strongly influence the selection of materials. Accordingly, increasing attention is now being given to the effect of the imposed chemical potential gradient upon thermochemical stability and structural integrity.},

abstract={In recent years the paper industry has been studying different technologies to reduce fresh water consumption in the mills. In this study micro-, ultra- and nanofiltration of some paper mill waters both on a laboratory and a pilot scale were compared. The performances of different membranes and modules are reported and some general conclusions are given. The performance of the membranes was evaluated by determining the reduction of certain measurable parameters in the feed solution such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total solids (TS), lignin, sugar, anionic trash (CD), ions, conductivity, turbidity, silt density index (SDI) and brightness decreasing substances. The tested tubular 0.4 μm microfiltration membrane was not suitable as a pretreatment step to nanofiltration. In ultrafiltration the tested cross rotational (CR) filter using flat sheet membranes gave significantly higher fluxes than the tested polymeric or ceramic tubular membranes. It was shown that the relatively low cut-off (30 kD) hydrophilic C30G membrane made from regenerated cellulose had higher fluxes both at neutral and acidic pH. Also the long time behaviour (duration four or six days) of the C30G was very good. It was also shown that the pH of the original feed, the experimental set-up and the membrane cut-off affected fouling the most in ultrafiltration. In nanofiltration the membrane structure and feed pH affected the results the most. Very good results were obtained by all the tested nanofiltration membranes. It was shown that fluxes similar to microfiltration are obtained by tubular ultrafiltration membranes and that the reductions were better. Moreover, the ultrafiltration process was more reliable than microfiltration as a pretreatment for nanofiltration because the obtained silt density index was always below the value 5 with ultrafiltration. However, it was also shown that in nanofiltration better reductions were obtained if no pretreatment was done, if it was not required by the module configuration.},

abstract={The catalytic properties for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSC) and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 (SCF) in solid solution were studied and compared with those of 5 wt% Li/MgO, using a steady/unsteady state packed-bed reactor and a transient microbalance. The results of the steady-state cofeed experiments show that LSC possesses OCM catalytic properties similar to those of Li/MgO in terms of C2 yield and selectivity at temperatures of around 800°C. The former gives a larger C2 space time yield than the latter. SCF exhibits poor OCM catalytic properties at 700-850°C. To further examine the suitability of LSC as a membrane material for use in a dense membrane reactor for OCM, the instant OCM selectivity and activity and oxygen consumption rate for LSC and 5% Li/MgO on exposure to pure methane in cyclic feed mode were measured respectively at 850°C and 800°C. For both materials, the unsteady-state cyclic feed operation gives smaller initial OCM activity and larger initial C2 selectivity than the cofeed steady state operation. Li/MgO quickly loses its OCM activity and selectivity in the unsteady state operation due to rapid consumption of the active sites. Up to 5 min of methane run time, LSC maintains appreciable OCM activity with poorer C2 selectivity as compared to the steady state cofeed operation. The surface of LSC membrane allow oxygen partial pressure may become nonselective for OCM in membrane reactor applications. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},
