It was found that this liquid membrane process yields much higher extraction percentages than the conventional solvent extraction process using the same amount of TNOA. The liquid membrane process is particularly suitable for dilute solutions such as leach and wash solutions of uranium ores. Effects of various factors on the stability of emulsions and the extraction rate and percent extraction of U (VI) were examined. Among various agents tested, Na2CO3 was found to be preferable to strip sulfato-complexes of U (VI) in the internal phase. Batch-type extractions of U (VI) by the emulsion-type liquid membrane method were performed to simulate a two-stage counter current extraction, and the experimental results suggest that the U (VI) concentration in the final raffinate can be lowered to below 1 g m-3 when the feed solution containing 1 kg m-3 U (VI) is treated by a two-stage extraction.

Sodium hydroxide was used as the stripping agent. The basic strength of the three amines in dodecane was studied by biphasic potentiometric titrations using a glass electrode. Flat-sheet membrane experiments, where the removal of nitric acid from the feed solution was followed by using either a glass electrode or a nitrate electrode, showed that the secondary and primary amines are more effective than the tertiary one. A detailed study of the permeation of nitric acid through SLMs as function of the concentration of the three amines in the liquid membrane was performed. Information was obtained on the diffusion coefficients of nitric acid in the aqueous phase and of the nitrate-alkylammonium salt in the membrane phase. A similar investigation was performed with HTcO4. In this case the secondary and tertiary amines proved to be better carriers. The secondary amine also performed better than the other two as a carrier for H2CrO4. The primary amine showed the unique feature of removing U (VI) as an anionic sulfato-complex, together with nitrate, pertechnetate and chromate ions, from the synthetic groundwater.

This fraction is separated from other subcellular organelles including Golgi and plasma membranes and synaptic vesicles that are sorted to the opposite end of the photoreceptor cell. The vesicles have very low buoyant density in sucrose gradients (rho = 1.09 g/ml), a relatively simple protein content and an orientation of rhodopsin expected of transport membranes. Reversible inhibition of transport by brefeldin A provides evidence that these vesicles are exocytic carriers. Specific immunoadsorption bound vesicles whose protein composition was indistinguishable from the membranes sedimented from the subcellular fraction. Some of these proteins may be cotransported with rhodopsin to the rod outer segment; others may be involved in vectorial transport.

The membranes are prepared by imbibing a thin, porous flat sheet support with a molten salt that reacts reversibly with the desired permeant gas, and which thus acts as a facilitated transport carrier of the gas. As an illustration of this concept, membranes consisting of molten lithium nitrate and sodium nitrate immobilized in thin porous metal supports were constructed and tested for the separation of oxygen from dried zero grade air at 350-524-degrees-C. These immobilized molten salt (IMS) membranes were shown to selectively permeate oxygen via a FT mechanism, which is based on the reversible reaction of oxygen with nitrite ions in the melts: M+NO2- + 1/2 O2 reversible M+NO3-, M = Li, Na For a NaNO3.IMS membrane oxygen permeabilities (Po(o2)) ranging from 58 to 1110 barrer with corresponding oxygen to nitrogen selectivities ranging from 4 to 80 were observed, at 452-degrees-C to 524-degrees-C and specified experimental conditions. There is a strong dependence of Po(o2) on operating temperature, which is indicative of a nitrate ion dissociation rate determining step for the FT of oxygen through the membrane. The advantages and limitations of immobilized molten salt versus conventional immobilized liquid FT membranes are discussed.

The membranes were prepared by immobilizing molten LiNO3 and ZnCl2, salts which react reversibly with NH3 but not with N2 or H2, in thin porous supports. Ammonia permeabilities of 10(3) to 10(5) barrer and NH3/N2 and NH3/H2 selectivities of at least 1000 were observed at 250-300-degrees-C. The extraordinary NH3 permeability through the ZnCl2 IMS membrane is explained by a carrier-mediated facilitated transport model wherein zinc ammoniate complexes function as mobile carriers.

The resistance of the cuticles to the caesium penetration was dependent on the counter-ions associated with the fixed negative ion exchange sites in the membrane. The mobility of hydrated potassium ions and their tenuous connection to -COOH--groups in the membrane encouraged caesium permeation in contrast to cuticular membranes with predominantly protonized ion exchange sites. Divalent calcium ions caused a strong reduction (4-20 times) of the caesium permeability which is decisive for the calculation of the caesium uptake by the intact leaf. Under these conditions, a penetration rate of the deposited caesium of 0.11 +/- 0.05% h-1 for pear cuticles and of 0.036 +/- 0.025% h-1 for cherry cuticles was measured after the adjustment to steady state conditions. Approximately 12-24% and 4.5-7.5% of initially retained caesium could be absorbed by the leaves of pear and cherry, respectively, in a rain-free period of 7 d in the area of Munich after wet deposition of fallout from the Chernobyl reactor accident. Furthermore, the caesium penetration from the physiological inside to the outside of the membrane was found to be smaller by a factor of 100-150 compared with that of the opposite direction.

The results of the flux measurements at 298.2 K and at feed pressures of up to 3 bars indicate that for c-2-butene/t-2-butene mixtures, a competitive effect in the Ag+ membranes occurs which increases the selectivity from the ideal Value of 1.4 calculated from pure gas fluxes to about 1.9-2.7 depending on the feed composition. Even at the highest feed gas concentrations the mixed gas selectivities do not drop below 1.9. The mixed gas solubility data of the Ag+ membranes show the same enhancement in selectivity compared to the ideal sorption selectivity calculated from pure gas solubilities. All experimental results can be described consistently with a reaction equilibrium model which does not require any adjustable parameters.

Experimental results corresponding to different values of the initial concentration of Cr(VI) in the aqueous phase in the range 50 g/m3 less-than-or-equal-to C0 less-than-or-equal-to 500 g/M3 Showed three different diffusional regimes depending on both the initial concentration of Cr(VI) and the linear velocities of the aqueous phase: (i) kinetic control of the mass transport in the aqueous phase, (ii) kinetic control of the mass transport through the membrane fiber wall and (iii) an intermediate region where the control is shared between the aqueous and the membrane phases. The integration of the mass conservation equation with a nonlinear equilibrium condition at the fiber wall agrees satisfactorily with the results of experiments performed at different initial concentrations of Cr(VI) and different values of the linear velocity of the aqueous phase in the range C0 greater-than-or-equal-to 50 g/m3 and 2.95 x 10(-3) m/s less-than-or-equal-to v less-than-or-equal-to 1.18 x 10(-2) m/s. An optimization of the parameters D, solute diffusivity in the aqueous phase, and K(eq), equilibrium constant of the extraction chemical reaction, with all the experimental results, using as criterion the minimum weighted standard deviation, gave as a result the value of the parameter D = 2.3 x 10(-9) m2/s and values of K(eq) dependent upon the initial concentration of Cr(VI) in the feed solution. The mass transfer model and parameters reported in this work are useful for the design and optimization of the nondispersive extraction of Cr(VI) in a hollow fiber module.

The essence of this work is the coupling of surface reactions with the bulk diffusion using a novel approach which differs from the conventional Wagner theory applicable only to limited cases. With this approach, fundamental equations based on various permeation mechanisms can be derived for oxygen permeation through thin mixed-conducting oxide membranes, which is impossible using conventional approach. In general, the final results are a complex implicit equation correlating the oxygen permeation flux to the driving force, membrane thickness, and rate constants with physical significance in each step. Somewhat simpler theoretical oxygen permeation equations are obtained for some special cases (mixed-conducting membranes with a rate-limiting step, ionic-conducting membranes, ionic-conducting membranes with a reducing agent in permeate side). Theoretical results derived using this new approach agree excellently with the experimental oxygen permeation data. It is theoretically and experimentally shown that for ionic conductors, the surface permeation parameter measured by the dynamic permeation method is directly related to the oxygen isotope exchange rate constant measured under equilibrium conditions.

In our approach to identify proteins involved in rhodopsin transport and sorting in retinal photoreceptors, we have found, using [P-32]GTP overlays of 2D gel blots, that six small GTP-binding proteins are tightly bound to the post-Golgi membranes immunoisolated with a mAb to the cytoplasmic domain of frog rhodopsin. We report here that one of these proteins is rab8. About 50% of photoreceptor rab8 is membrane associated and similar to 13% is tightly bound to the post-Golgi vesicles. By confocal microscopy, antibody to rab8 specifically labels calycal processes and the actin bundles of the photoreceptor inner segment that extend inward to the junctional complexes that comprise the outer limiting membrane. Anti-rab8 shows a striking periodicity of high density labeling at 1+/-0.12 mu m intervals along the actin bundles. Rhodopsin-bearing post-Golgi membranes cluster around the base of the cilium where rab8 and actin are also co-localized, as revealed by confocal microscopy of retinal sections double labeled with anti-rab8 and phalloidin. Microfilaments have been implicated in rod outer segment (ROS) disk morphogenesis. Our data suggest that rab6, which we have previously localized to the post-Golgi compartment, and rab8 associate with the post-Golgi membranes sequentially at different stages of transport, rab8 may mediate later steps that involve interaction of transport membranes with actin filaments and may participate in microfilament- dependent ROS disk morphogenesis.

In particular the oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k cm s(-1)), which can be determined by isotopic exchange measurements is proportional to a characteristic electrode current density (j(E) A cm(-2)) which determines the electrode resistance (R(E) Omega cm(2)) in solid-state electrochemical systems. For ceramic ion-conducting membranes a characteristic membrane thickness (L(c)) at which the changeover from bulk to surface control occurs is shown to be equal to D-*/k where D-* (cm(2) s(-1)) is the oxygen self-diffusion coefficient in the oxide material. Attention is also drawn to correlations between D and k. It is noted, for example, that the ratio D/k often has a value around 10(-2) cm (100 mu m) for most AO(2) fluorite and ABO(3) perovskite oxide materials, which implies that fabricating membranes less than 100 mu m thick will not be advantageous unless the value of k can be specifically increased. Mechanisms responsible for correlations between D and k remain obscure and should be a fruitful area for further investigations. Finally, specific examples of materials selection for ceramic fuel cell operation over a wide range of temperatures (450-1000 degrees C) are briefly surveyed.

However, in this study, it is demonstrated that some macrocyclic carriers like calix[4]arene crown ethers and calixspherands show such slow kinetics of decomplexation that the release of salt from the membrane strongly affects the transport rates. The influence of rates of decomplexation on alkali cation transport can be described by a simple mathematical model. Data for the rate-limiting steps in the transport process have been obtained from maximum fluxes, lag-time measurements, temperature variation, and membrane permeation experiments with dyes. The relative contributions of diffusive and kinetic resistances inside the SLM were determined by variation of the membrane thickness. When kinetics of release are relatively slow, the transport selectivity (K+/Na+) is lower than in the transport regime of diffusion limitation.

The preparation of grafted benzo-15-crown-5 membranes and the results concerning transport experiments are reported here. It has been demonstrated that covalently bound carriers allow facilitated transport of K+ ions versus Li+ ions to take place with high diffusion rates, high facilitation factor and good selectivity. The special role of counter-ion is also put forward and discussed. A transport mechanism which fits the experimental results is proposed.

The oxygen permeability, the oxygen/nitrogen separation factor, the permeation flux Q(OEA) and the oxygen concentration Y(o2) of the oxygen-enriched air (OEA) through the cellulose derivative membranes with different LCs were studied by a constant pressure-variable volume method. The experimental results show that the membrane-forming ability, uniformity, toughness and air-separation properties of the cellulose derivatives have been improved by adding no more than 12 wt% LC. The air-separation properties of the resulting membranes vary significantly with membrane composition, temperature and pressure difference. Of all the membranes, the COC/EC (4/96) membrane of thickness 18 mum exhibits the highest Q(OEA) value of 1.8 x 10(-4) cm3 (STP) s-1 cm-2 and maintains the Y(o2) value of 38.8% in a single operation.

Membranes consist of melts of the salt hydrates tetramethylammonium fluoride tetrahydrate, [(CH3)(4)N]F . 4H(2)O, or tetraethylammonium acetate tetrahydrate, [(C2H5)(4)N]CH3CO2 . 4H(2)O, immobilized in films of Celgard 3401(R). Operating at 50 degrees C, both membranes exhibited CO2 permeabilities which increased with decreasing feed partial pressure of CO2, characteristic of a facilitated transport membrane. Selectivities of CO2/H-2 and of CO2/CH4 increased with decreasing feed pressure since H-2 and CH4 permeances were independent of feed pressure. Selectivities of CO2/H-2 were disappointingly low due to permeation of H-2 through the dense phase of Celgard(R). With some difficulty, the microporous support was eliminated by construction of membranes consisting of liquid [(CH3)(4)N]F . 4H(2)O on the surface of a film of poly( trimethylsilylpropyne). Selectivities of CO2/H-2 as high as 360 were then observed at low feed partial pressures of CO2. Modeling of membrane properties is consistent with permeation of CO2 by a facilitated transport mechanism with reasonable derived diffusivities for the chemically bound CO2 carrier species.

The membranes are based on the polyelectrolyte poly(vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium fluoride), PVBTAF, and exhibit exceptional permselective properties. For example, at 23 degrees C and 32 cmHg CO2, a PVBTAF composite membrane displayed a CO2 permeance of 6x10(-6) cm(3)/cm(2)s cmHg and CO2/H-2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities of 87 and 1000, respectively. The CO2/H-2 selectivity is the highest reported for any membrane. The permeance of both CO2 and H2S increased with decreasing feed partial pressure of the respective gases, a characteristic of facilitated transport membranes. The permselectivity is also dependent on the hydration state of the membrane and is optimal at a gas stream relative humidity in the range 0.25-0.50. The membranes show no deterioration after 30 days of continuous operation but react with trace level sulfur-containing contaminants common to cylinder H2S.

Addition of TPTCl to the liquid anion-exchange membrane, based on the quaternary ammonium salt, gave rise to a quite different selectivity pattern from the so-called Hofmeister anion series observed for the liquid anion-exchange membrane. An additivity rule of the bi-ionic membrane potential was observed to hold for the Liquid anion-exchange membrane containing TPTCl. Thus, the following multiple chain rule was derived for selectivity coefficients; k(1,n)(pot) = K-1,2(pot) . K-2,3(pot) ... K-i,K-(i+1)(pot) ... K-n-1,n(pot), where K-i,i+1(pot) is the selectivity coefficient of the membrane for the (i+1)th ion over the ith ion.

The model is based on the film theory approach combined with facilitation factors. Mass transfer coefficients are calculated using published correlations and chemical reaction effects are accounted for by calculated facilitation factors. The shell side flow maldistribution due to random packing of fibers in the module bundle is estimated using Voronoi tessellations and the friction factor-Re. The computer simulation of random packing is accomplished using random sequential addition. The model is correlated with experimental data on the extraction of uranyl nitrate from an acidic aqueous medium into TBP/DIPB extractant. The model correlates experimental data very well for this system. By accounting for the non-linearity of the interfacial effects in this way the rigorous solution of a system of coupled non-linear PDEs may be avoided, but the model can still provide accurate predictive design and analysis information for the system.

In this paper, we report the development of a polymer membrane containing silver(I) ion that facilitates the transport of ethylene in the absence of solvent. Blends of ionically conductive and electrically conductive polymers were found to have the appropriate electronic environment to allow reaction of silver(I) ion and ethylene. The results for the ethylene/ethane separation were obtained with composite membranes of silver(I)-form Nafion(R) and 2 wt% poly(pyrrole). Permeation measurements were performed with ethylene/ethane mixtures at total feed pressures ranging from 760 to 1900 mmHg and at temperatures of 40 degrees C to 70 degrees C, Pure gas permeability measurements were obtained at a total feed pressure of 1900 mmHg and temperatures of 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Ethylene/ethane separation factors with the silver(I)-form Nafion-poly(pyrrole) composite membranes increased from 8 to 15 as temperature decreased. Ethylene permeabilities increased from 0.2 to 1 Barrer over the temperature range of 30 degrees C to 70 degrees C:. An ethylene/ethane mixed gas permeability ratio of about 2 was observed with non-reactive proton-form Nafion-poly(pyrrole) composite membranes, Ethylene permeation measurements as a function of membrane thickness suggested that the facilitated transport of ethylene approached the reaction-limited regime at membrane thickness of 5 mu m. The complexation between ethylene molecules and silver(I) ions in Nafion-poly(pyrrole) composite membrane was observed with FTIR spectroscopy.

The use of copolymer supports containing a donor atom capable of covalently binding to the metal centre allows production of solid state systems that display reversible binding of O-2 With a half life of the order of 30 days. However, these systems do not function as facilitated transport membranes for enhanced dioxygen separation. Scanning electron microscopy studies indicate this is because the copolymer/complex films show phase separation arising from the charged nature of the lacunar complexes.

We are developing a mixed-conducting, dense ceramic membrane for selectively transporting oxygen and hydrogen. Ceramic membranes made of Sr-Fe-Co oxide, which has high combined electronic and oxygen ionic conductions, can be used to selectively transport oxygen during the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas (syngas, CO + H-2). We have measured the steady-state oxygen permeability of SrFeCo0.5Ox as a function of oxygen partial-pressure gradient and temperature. At 900 degrees C, oxygen permeability was approximate to 2.5 sec cm(-2) min(-1) for a 2.9 mm thick membrane and this value increases as membrane thickness decreases. We have fabricated tubular SrFeCo0.5Ox membranes and operated them at 900 degrees C for > 1000 h during conversion of methane into syngas. The hydrogen ion (proton) transport properties of Ba(Ce,Y)O3-delta were investigated by impedance spectroscopy and open-cell voltage measurements. High proton conductivity and a high protonic transference number make Ba(Ce,Y)O3-delta a potential membrane for hydrogen separation. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Metal ions that potentially could be used as molecular templates were screened by first characterizing the polymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) in the presence of the metal salts. Thermal polymerizations and phot,polymerizations were used to elucidate which metals adversely effect the polymerization reaction via radical scavenging, chain transfer, light absorption, and other side reactions. HEMA polymerizations were used to investigate these effects because only linear polymers can form, and there will be no rate effects from cyclization. Photopolymerizations of templated PEG200DA exhibited a decrease in autoacceleration as an indication of pseudocrown ether formation due to the reduction in the degree of cross-linking with cyclization. Four metal salts, Co(NO3)(2). 6H(2)O, Ni(NO3)(2).6H2O, Zn(NO3)(2). 6H(2)O, and Cd(NO3)(2). 4H(2)O, were found to make suitable templating ions. Although Cu(NO3)(2).(2.5)H2O and CrCl3. 6H(2)O formed appropriate complexes with PEG200DA, these metals act as radical scavengers and did not permit the desired polymerization. The peak rate was decreased up to 69% for the partially dried Co(II)/PEG200DA complex at a metal concentration of 1.27 M. Facilitated transport membranes exhibited a selectivity of 1.3 for potassium over sodium and 27.5 for potassium over neodymium, and a benchmark comparison was made to an analogous polymer inclusion membrane that contained dibenzo-18-crown-6 as the carrier which had similar selectivities.

Boehmite sol maintains its dynamic stability in the pH range of 3.5-4. Adsorption of metal salt on the sol particles can only be performed in the above pH range, but the adsorption can still be optimized by proper choice of ligand. Therefore, the effect of the ligands (NH3, Cl-, EDTA) on the adsorption of the noble metal ions (Pd(II), Pt(II), Pt(IV) and Rh(lll)) as a function of pH on gamma-Al2O3 particles was studied. Thus the noble metal complexes which can significantly adsorb in the above pH range were found. Using the complexes, the noble metal ion modified boehmite sols were synthesized. Then by the set-gel process, the porous noble metal/ceramic cataytic membranes were prepared. The membranes were further characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SEM-WDX (wave dispersion of X-ray). The H-2 and N-2 permeation through these membranes at elevated temperatures was also measured. Based on the above experiments, the novel technique can produce the mesoporous catalytically active ceramic membranes without any defects and with a uniform dispersion of the active materials in the coating.

The O-2/N-2 selectivities of the membrane with 4-DMAP, DMSO and pyrazine were 160, 3 and 2.2, respectively. The oxygenation rate in the DMSO system and the deoxygenation rate in the pyrazine system were remarkably smaller than those of the other systems. Low O-2/N-2 selectivity in the DMSO system is due to the slow oxygenation of the complex and that in the pyrazine system is attributable to the low deoxygenation rate. Slow oxygenation in the DMSO system may be due to the small overlap of d(z)(2) orbital having an unpaired electron with the antibonding orbital of oxygen.

The inclusion of metal affinity ligands as fixed site carriers within poly(vinyl alcohol) gel membranes resulted in increases in the mass transfer coefficient of histidine and increases in the selectivity of histidine to a noninteracting amino acid control, phenylalanine. Membranes containing chelated Cu+2 or Co+2 exhibited the largest increase in histidine mass transfer rate and those containing Ni+2 or Zn+2 displayed no increase in mass transfer coefficient relative to the control membrane. The effect of chelated metal type on histidine transport was similar to trends exhibited by other metal affinity separation methods.

Oxygen permeation and electric conduction through these BYS/Ag dual-phase membranes were studied in thr temperature range of 650-850 degrees C. The percolative BYS/Ag 40% and non-percolative BYS/Ag 30% membranes exhibit about 50-fold and 10-fold increase, respectively, in oxygen permeation flux compared to BYS membranes. For a 1.3 mm thick BYS/Ag 40% membrane, an oxygen permeation flux of 5.8 x 10(-7) mol/cm(2) s was measured at 850 degrees C with oxygen partial pressures at the feed and permeate sides being 0.21 and 0.009 arm, respectively. The activation energies for oxygen permeation in the temperature range of 650-850"C are 79.30 and 87.30 kT/mol for the BYS/Ag 30% and BYS/Ag 40% membranes, respectively. For the non-percolative BYS/Ag membrane, the presence of Ag enhances the surface reaction rate for oxygen permeation. The continuous silver phase in the percolative BYS/Ag membrane increases both the electronic conductivity and surface reaction rate which result in substantial improvement of oxygen permeance.

Pseudo-crown ethers were synthesized from the photopolymerization of metal : poly(ethylene glycol 200) diacrylate (PEG200DA) complexes. The metal:monomer complex led to a near-circular conformation of the monomer in which the two reactive endgroups were in close proximity; thus, the probability of intramolecular cyclization (i.e. pseudo-crown ether formation) was increased. Facilitated transport membranes using pseudo-crown ethers as carrier species were selective for alkali metals over transition and lanthanide metals. The K over Na selectivity was as high as 1.5, while the selectivity of K over Nd3+ was as high as 3700. The flux and selectivity of metal ions were a function of carrier concentration and type as well as the cross-linking of the pseudo-crown ether network. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, using MRP overexpressing multidrug resistant nasopharyngeal cancer cells, we examined the expression of apoptosis related genes including p53, p21(WAFl), bax and bcl-Xs between drug sensitive KB and its resistant KB/7D cells. We also examined whether the introduction of apoptosis related gene could increase the sensitivity to anticancer drugs in association with apoptotic cell death. The relative resistances to anticancer drugs in KB/7D cells evaluated by IC50 values were 3.6, 61.3, 10.4 and 10.5 to adriamycin (ADM), etoposide (VP-16), vincristine (VCR) and vindesine (VDS), respectively. The resistance to anticancer drugs in KB/7D cells was associated with the attenuation of internucleosomal DNA ladder formation in apoptosis. Of important, the mRNA expression of bcl-Xs gene in KB/7D cells was decreased in one-fourth as compared to that of KB cells among the apoptosis genes. The mRNA expression of bcl-Xs gene in a bcl-Xs transfected clone (KB/7Dbcl-Xs) was increased about 2-fold compared to that of KB/7Dneo cells, while the mRNA expression of MRP gene was not significantly different in KB/7bcl-Xs and KB/7Dneo cells. The sensitivities to anticancer drugs including ADM, VCR and VDS except VP-16 were increased in KB/7Dbcl-Xs cells, in turn, the relative resistance in KB/7Dbcl-Xs cells was decreased to 1.4, 4.0, and 3.0 in ADM, VCR and VDS, respectively, as compared to those of KB/7Dneo cells. Of interest, the studies on the accumulation of [H-3]VCR showed that the decrease of [3H]VCR accumulation in KB/7Dbcl-Xs was not significantly different from that of KB/7Dneo cells. Collectively, these results indicated that the mechanism(s) of drug resistance in KB/7D cells could be explained at least by two factors: a) reduced drug accumulation mediated by MRP; b) resistance to apoptosis due to the decreased expression of the bcl-Xs gene. These results also indicated that the multidrug resistance mediated by MRP might be partially overcome by introducing apoptosis gene into drug resistant cells without modulation of MRP function in drug accumulation.

In particular, the physicochemical and transport properties of fluorite-related oxides and the characteristics of electronic conduction in these solid electrolytes are briefly reviewed. Emphasis is given to electrocatalytic and electrochemical properties of cerium-containing oxides, which are promising materials for electrodes of electrochemical cells operating in reducing atmospheres, and mixed-conducting membranes. A comparative analysis of specific features of the solid-electrolyte ceramics based on hafnia, zirconia, ceria, and thoria is performed in order to reveal basic tendencies of oxygen ionic transport in fluorite-type oxides, and to identify the potential applicability of these materials in various high-temperature electrochemical devices.

Specifically, the transport of 1,5-hexadiene and of 1-hexene within these membranes was studied and a hypothetical conformation for the silver (I) complex of 1,5-hexadiene in aqueous systems is discussed. Absorption of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene into aqueous silver nitrate solutions revealed predominantly 1:1 complexation of these olefins with silver. Absorption and transport experiments in silver-exchanged Neosepta (R) CM-1 membranes confirmed the predominance of 1:1 1,5-hexadiene/silver (I) complexation in this membrane as well, showing that transport through these membranes occurs primarily through a 1:1 1,5-hexadiene/silver (1) complexation mechanism.

Studies of oxygen permeation through CGO-LSM composite ceramics, containing similar volume fractions of the phases, showed that the oxygen transfer is limited by the bulk ionic conductivity. The oxygen conduction in the composites depends strongly on processing conditions, decreasing with interdiffusion of the phase components. Blocking oxygen ionic conduction is assumed to be due to formation of layers with low ionic conductivity at the CGO grain boundaries, caused by diffusion of lanthanum and strontium into CGO. The permeation fluxes through CGO-LSM membranes at high feed-side oxygen pressures(1-50 atm) exhibit Wagner-type behavior and exceed significantly the oxygen permeability at lower oxygen pressures.

J	Kim, J; Lin, YS				Kim, J; Lin, YS			Synthesis and oxygen-permeation properties of thin YSZ/Pd composite membranes	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article							YTTRIA-STABILIZED ZIRCONIA; CERAMIC MEMBRANE; OXIDE; DEPOSITION; METHANE	Thin dense yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ)/Pd composite (dual-phase) membranes were fabricated on porous YSZ membranes by a new approach that combines the reservoir method and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. A thin porous YSZ layer was coated on a porous alumina support by dip coating the YSZ suspension. A continuous Pd phase was formed inside pores of the YSZ layer by the reservoir method. The residual pores of the YSZ/Pd layer were plugged with yttria/zirconia by CVD to ensure the gas tightness of the membranes. The oxygen-permeation fluxes through these composite (dual-phase) membranes, measured in situ in the CVD reactor are 20 x 10(-8) and 4.8 X 10(-8) mol/cm(2).s at 1,050 degrees C when air and oxygen are used as the permeate gases, respectively. These oxygen-permeation values are about I order of magnitude higher than those of pure YSZ membranes prepared under similar conditions. The apparent activation energies for oxygen permeation at 900 -1,050 degrees C are 193 kJ/mol for thin YSZ/Pd composite (dual-phase) membranes and 124 kJ/mol for pure YSZ membranes. These results are explained in terms of relative importance of various mass-transfer steps for oxygen permeation and microstructure of the YSZ/Pd composite membranes prepared by this technique.

Successful application of ITM technology will allow significant improvement in the performance of several large-scale industrial processes. The ITM Oxygen process, in which ITMs are used to separate high-purity oxygen from air, has the potential for significant advantages when integrated with power generation cycles. The ITM Syngas process, by combining air separation and high-temperature syngas generation processes into a single compact ceramic membrane reactor, has the potential for substantially reducing the capital investment for gas-to-liquid (GTL) plants and for distributed hydrogen. The development efforts are major, long-term and high risk, and place severe demands on the performance and property requirements of the ITM materials. Air Products and Chemicals has joined with the U.S. Department of Energy, Ceramatec and other partners to develop, scale-up and commercialize these technologies. In addition, Air Products and Ceramatec are developing the SEOS(TM) Oxygen Generator, an electrically-driven, small scale, oxygen generation and removal technology using ITMs, which could have a significant impact in the global market for distributed oxygen and inert gases. This paper describes the stages of development of these three related technologies, their industrial applications, and the technical hurdles that must be overcome before successful commercialization.

This model correlates transport properties of mobile defects to some important parameters such as diffusion coefficient, film thickness. temperature and gas partial pressures. The theoretical analysis was carried out using the SrCe0.95Yb0.05O2.975 (SCY) mixed conducting membrane and the effects of various parameters on the ionic permeation are discussed in detail. The predicted values generated from the present model show good agreement with literature experimental data given by Hamakawa et al. [J. Electrochem. Sec. 141 (1994) 1720]. Based on the available equilibrium data of the (SCY) mixed conducting membrane, the simulated results reveal that. at an operating temperature of less than 1200 K, the membrane behaves as a mixed proton-hole conductor, while it switches to a mixed oxygen vacancy-hole conductor when the operating temperature is increased to 1600 K.
